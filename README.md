## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

3 of my favorite applications include Tik Tok, Instagram, and Tsum Tsum. Tik Tok's story mode feature is great for when you want to take pictures of yourself with filters that are offered on the app. I also like how it is easy to send someone a Tik Tok through the app itself. What I like about Instagram is that you can comment gifs on other people's post. Another feature that I enjoy about the app is that you can unsend messages that you didn't mean to send. I like Tsum Tsum because of their animations as well as the different sound effects that are played during the game. There is a system where you can use coins to buy new characters as well as events that keep the user engaged.

An app I would like the build is a cooking game. As a kid, I loved playing games where you got to make burgers and serve customers. I would change this up to include some of my favorite foods and possibly bring attention to Asian cuisine. Some features I would include is a score board, a feature that uses coins to collect new items, and a feature that allows you to friend others on the app.
